# Machine-Learning Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine-learning model using the PyCaret framework. Using a given dataset, the model seeks to predict students' dropout and academic success. The model's performance will be evaluated based on unseen data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named "Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success." It was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository/Kaggle. You can access the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success.
