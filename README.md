# Machine-Learning Prediction Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify Osmancik and Cammeo rice grains using machine learning. The dataset contains images of 3810 grains with seven morphological features. The goal is to build an accurate model using PyCaret for classification and prediction on unseen data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named "Rice (Cammeo and Osmancik)." It was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository/Kaggle.
